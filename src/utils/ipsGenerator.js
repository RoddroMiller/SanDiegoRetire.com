Email:                 ${clientInfo.email || 'Not Provided'}
Phone:                 ${clientInfo.phone || 'Not Provided'}
Marital Status:        ${clientInfo.isMarried ? 'Married' : 'Single'}
Current Age:           ${clientInfo.currentAge}

Current Retirement Status: ${clientInfo.isRetired ? 'Currently Retired' : 'Pre-Retirement'}

================================================================================
SECTION 2: INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES
================================================================================

Primary Objective:
-----------------
Generate sustainable retirement income while preserving capital for long-term
growth and legacy planning.

Specific Goals:
--------------
1. Provide monthly retirement income of ${formatCurrency(inputs.monthlySpending)}
   (adjusted for inflation at ${inputs.personalInflationRate}% annually)

2. Maintain portfolio sustainability through a ${planningHorizon}-year distribution phase

3. Optimize Social Security timing for maximum lifetime benefit
   - Primary: Claiming at age ${inputs.ssStartAge} (${formatCurrency(inputs.ssPIA)}/month at FRA)
   ${clientInfo.isMarried ? `- Partner: Claiming at age ${inputs.partnerSSStartAge} (${formatCurrency(inputs.partnerSSPIA)}/month at FRA)` : ''}

4. Preserve capital for potential legacy transfer

5. Target Success Rate: ${monteCarloData?.successRate?.toFixed(1) || 'N/A'}% probability of
   not depleting assets over ${planningHorizon} years

================================================================================
SECTION 3: TIME HORIZON
================================================================================

${yearsToRetirement > 0 ? `
Accumulation Phase:    ${yearsToRetirement} years (until age ${clientInfo.retirementAge})
                       Current Portfolio: ${formatCurrency(clientInfo.currentPortfolio)}
                       Annual Contributions: ${formatCurrency(clientInfo.annualSavings)}
                       Expected Growth Rate: ${clientInfo.expectedReturn}%
` : ''}
Distribution Phase:    ${planningHorizon} years (ages ${clientInfo.retirementAge} to ${clientInfo.retirementAge + planningHorizon})

Initial Distribution Portfolio: ${formatCurrency(totalPortfolio)}

================================================================================
SECTION 4: RISK TOLERANCE
================================================================================

Risk Profile:          ${riskProfile}

Assessment Based On:
- Time horizon and distribution needs
- Allocation to growth vs. conservative assets
- Monte Carlo simulation success probability
- Client's income replacement ratio

Portfolio Characteristics:
- Expected Return:     ${expectedReturn}%
- Expected Volatility: ${expectedStdDev}%
- Success Rate:        ${monteCarloData?.successRate?.toFixed(1) || 'N/A'}%

The client understands that:
1. All investments carry risk, including potential loss of principal
2. Past performance does not guarantee future results
3. Higher expected returns generally require accepting higher volatility
4. The bucket strategy is designed to manage sequence-of-returns risk

================================================================================
SECTION 5: ASSET ALLOCATION - TIME-SEGMENTED BUCKET STRATEGY
================================================================================

Strategy:              ${selectedStrategy?.name || 'Current Model'}

The portfolio employs a time-segmented bucket strategy, allocating assets based
on when they will be needed for distributions. This approach manages
sequence-of-returns risk by protecting near-term income needs while allowing
long-term assets to grow.

BUCKET ALLOCATION:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bucket    | Name             | Allocation | Amount          | Time Horizon
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B1        | Short-Term       | ${allocPcts.b1.padStart(6)}%   | ${formatCurrency(allocation.b1Val || 0).padStart(15)} | Years 1-3
B2        | Mid-Term         | ${allocPcts.b2.padStart(6)}%   | ${formatCurrency(allocation.b2Val || 0).padStart(15)} | Years 4-6
B3        | Balanced 60/40   | ${allocPcts.b3.padStart(6)}%   | ${formatCurrency(allocation.b3Val || 0).padStart(15)} | Years 7-15
B4        | Income & Growth  | ${allocPcts.b4.padStart(6)}%   | ${formatCurrency(allocation.b4Val || 0).padStart(15)} | Years 16-20
B5        | Long-Term Growth | ${allocPcts.b5.padStart(6)}%   | ${formatCurrency(allocation.b5Val || 0).padStart(15)} | Years 21+
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total                        | 100.0%   | ${formatCurrency(totalPortfolio).padStart(15)}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUCKET DESCRIPTIONS:

B1 - Short-Term (${allocPcts.b1}%):
   Investment Types: Cash, Money Market, Short-Term Treasury Bills
   Expected Return: ${assumptions.b1.return}% | Volatility: ${assumptions.b1.stdDev}%
   Purpose: Immediate liquidity for years 1-3 distributions

B2 - Mid-Term (${allocPcts.b2}%):
   Investment Types: Short-Term Bonds, Investment Grade Corporate Bonds
   Expected Return: ${assumptions.b2.return}% | Volatility: ${assumptions.b2.stdDev}%
   Purpose: Near-term stability for years 4-6 distributions

B3 - Balanced 60/40 (${allocPcts.b3}%):
   Investment Types: Balanced Funds, 60% Equity / 40% Fixed Income
   Expected Return: ${assumptions.b3.return}% | Volatility: ${assumptions.b3.stdDev}%
   Purpose: Moderate growth with reduced volatility for mid-term needs

B4 - Income & Growth (${allocPcts.b4}%):
   Investment Types: Dividend Stocks, REITs, Preferred Securities
   Expected Return: ${assumptions.b4.return}% | Volatility: ${assumptions.b4.stdDev}%
   Purpose: Income generation with capital appreciation potential

B5 - Long-Term Growth (${allocPcts.b5}%):
   Investment Types: Domestic Equity, International Equity, Small Cap
   Expected Return: ${assumptions.b5.return}% | Volatility: ${assumptions.b5.stdDev}%
   Purpose: Maximum long-term growth for late-stage distributions and legacy

================================================================================
SECTION 6: DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY
================================================================================

Method:                ${distributionStrategy.name}

${distributionStrategy.description}

Annual Distribution Target: ${formatCurrency(inputs.monthlySpending * 12)}
Monthly Distribution:       ${formatCurrency(inputs.monthlySpending)}
Distribution Rate:          ${((inputs.monthlySpending * 12 / totalPortfolio) * 100).toFixed(2)}% of initial portfolio

Income Sources at Retirement:
-----------------------------
1. Portfolio Distributions:     Variable (as needed to meet spending)
2. Social Security (Primary):   ${formatCurrency(inputs.ssPIA)}/month starting age ${inputs.ssStartAge}
${clientInfo.isMarried ? `3. Social Security (Partner):   ${formatCurrency(inputs.partnerSSPIA)}/month starting age ${inputs.partnerSSStartAge}` : ''}
${inputs.monthlyPension > 0 ? `${clientInfo.isMarried ? '4' : '3'}. Pension Income:              ${formatCurrency(inputs.monthlyPension)}/month starting age ${inputs.pensionStartAge}${inputs.pensionCOLA ? ' (with COLA)' : ''}` : ''}

================================================================================
SECTION 7: REBALANCING POLICY
================================================================================

${distributionFreq === 0 ? `
Rebalancing Approach:  Sequential Draw-Down (No Periodic Rebalancing)

Under this strategy, buckets are not rebalanced to target allocations. Instead:
- Distributions are taken from B1 until depleted (approximately years 1-3)
- Then from B2 until depleted (approximately years 4-6)
- Then from B3 until depleted (approximately years 7-15)
- Then from B4 until depleted (approximately years 16-20)
- Finally from B5 for remaining years

This approach allows growth buckets (B4, B5) maximum time to compound before
being accessed.
` : `
Rebalancing Frequency: ${distributionFreq === 1 ? 'Annually' : `Every ${distributionFreq} Years`}

Rebalancing Triggers:
1. Time-based: Portfolio reviewed and rebalanced per schedule above
2. Threshold-based: Consider rebalancing if any bucket deviates more than
   5 percentage points from target allocation
3. Event-based: Material changes in client circumstances or market conditions

Rebalancing Methodology:
- Sell from overweighted buckets
- Purchase into underweighted buckets
- Consider tax implications and transaction costs
- Maintain adequate cash reserves for near-term distributions
